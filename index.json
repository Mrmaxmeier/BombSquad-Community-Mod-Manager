                "Here's a bunch of new and updated minigames!Important notes:bsPowerup.py is a modified version of the game file. It has to replace the original game file.  Can mod manager do this? The modification is that it adds 2 new powerups: Snowballs and a Bunny helper bot that attacks other players (not you). For this to work it also requires BunnyBuddy.py and SnoBallz.py.  I put that requirement (I think) in the bsPowerup.json file. You can see these in action on my game server. I couldn't figure out any other way to add the new powerups to every game other than modifying the original bsPowerup file.The Snowball Fight minigame also requires SnoBallz.py.  I added a \"requires\" line in the .json file. It's the only minigame here that's not completely standalone.I called BuddyBunny, SnoBallz, and bsPowerup all \"utilities\" instead of \"minigames\" or \"libraries\" in the json files.  I wasn't sure what would be best.  If there's any way I can help, please let me know.",
